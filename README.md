# Pandas_Challenge

For this week's assignment, I chose HeroesofPymoli over the PyCitySchools. I enjoy video games, so I felt that it might be nice to see data visualization at a level relevant to myself. This was a challenge for me, as I realized that I did not save multiples files of the code. I would get the correct answer, but attempt to fix the formatting or the sorted values. It didn't work out well, but I continued to work at the problem. I had a few issues with the values, so I'm not quite sure.
